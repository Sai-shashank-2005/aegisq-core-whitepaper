# AegisQ Consensus Protocol — Whitepaper

<p align="center">
<b>Deterministic Consensus • Adversarial Analysis • System-Level Design</b>
</p>

---

## Overview

This repository contains the official whitepaper for the **AegisQ Protocol**, a deterministic consensus system designed to analyze correctness, execution behavior, and failure modes of BFT-style protocols.

The document focuses on how consensus systems behave under controlled execution and what is required to ensure safety and liveness in real-world environments.

---

## What This Covers

- Deterministic consensus execution model  
- Quorum-based finality (2f + 1)  
- Transaction processing and block construction  
- Cryptographic design (Dilithium + SHA3-256)  
- Observability and system introspection  
- Failure modes under adversarial conditions  

---

## Key Contributions

- Demonstrates how consensus systems can fail despite quorum guarantees  
- Identifies replay attacks, ordering divergence, and liveness failures  
- Connects system design with adversarial analysis  
- Provides structured insights into consensus correctness

## Related Implementation

The concepts described in this whitepaper are implemented in:

- AegisQ Core — consensus engine  
- AegisQ Explorer — observability layer  

This repository focuses on **design and analysis**, while implementation is available separately.

## Positioning

AegisQ is positioned as:

> A deterministic consensus system designed to understand how distributed protocols execute, validate, and fail under adversarial conditions.
